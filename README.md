# Fruit-Frontier

****This game only works for computers w/ Windows 32bit****

Created a computer game using Python's Pygame library. cx_freeze was used to bundle up the code and images into one executable file. The goal is to avoid the oranges and get as high of a score as possible.

Coco-shield: If hit by an orange after picking up this power-up, you teleport to a random location in the game.

Pineapple-gun: You are able to shoot spikes at the oranges by repeatedly pressing the space bar. 

Rainbow-grapes: Gives you invincibility for a given amount of time.

In order to begin playing, go into the dist file and download the executable file.
